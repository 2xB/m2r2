This is `$E = mc^2$` inline math.

This first math `$x^2$` in this line will render. This one `$z^3$` should as well.

Also within parentheses (`$x^2$`) and (`$z^3$`).

```bash
for (( counter=10; counter>0; counter-- ))
do
echo -n "$counter "
done
printf "\n"
```

Let's snake things up:

```python
def f(x, y):
    return x + y + 1
```

And again:
```python
def f(x, y):
    return x + y + 1
```

With space:

``` python
def f(x, y):
    return x + y + 1
```

Again, with space:
``` python
def f(x, y):
    return x + y + 1
```
